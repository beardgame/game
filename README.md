# Bearded.Game
Bearded.Game is a small framework built to easily start up new game projects. It is based on a selection of tools from different libraries, written by [Paul Scharf](http://github.com/amulware) and [Tom Rijnbeek](http://github.com/tomrijnbeek), primarily developed for [Roche Fusion](http://store.steampowered.com/app/334140) and other projects.

The libraries in particular are:

* [amulware.Graphics](https://github.com/amulware/awgraphics)
* [Bearded.Utilities](https://github.com/beardgame/utilities)
* [TomRijnbeek.Audio](https://github.com/tomrijnbeek/tomrijnbeek-audio)

The libraries are included as submodule to make it easy to work on these libraries in the context of a small gaming framework.

## Current State
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/beardgame/game.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/beardgame/game)

The library is currently in a scaffolding phase. It is therefore not recommended to use this library, while it is developed into a workable state.
